                Delivering Happiness details the story of Tony Hsieh and his company Zappos, an example of how thinking long term and following your passions first can lead to not just profits, but a happy life for you, your employees, and customers.<br/><br/>
                The book provides an alternative approach to a corporate culture that focuses on the simple concept of making people around you happy, and by doing so, increasing your own happiness and company productivity.</p><br/>
            <h3 class="prothreep">A few key points asserted in the book:</h3><br/>
            <p class="prothreep">1.It is important to discover the one thing you are passionate about, and conversely, what you don’t want to do</p><br/>
            <p class="prothreep">2.Take things slow. Growing fast can be counterproductive if the wrong people are hired</p><br/>
            <p class="prothreep">3.The success of your company is closely tied to your culture, so focus on creating one that you believe in</p><br/>
            <p class="prothreep">4.Strive to be always learning, and make it a priority for your employees as well</p><br/>
            <p class="prothreep">5.Choose one thing you want your organization to be the best at and focus on that thing</p><br/>
            <p class="prothreep">6.Don’t focus on building buzz around your brand, but rather build engagement and trust by treating people well</p><br/>
            <p class="prothreep">7.Have a vision of a higher purpose so that your ultimate outcome will be happiness</p><br/>   
            <h3 class="prothreep">In Conclusion,</h3>
