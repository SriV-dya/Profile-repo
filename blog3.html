            <h1>A Git Newbie</h1><br/>
            <h3 class="prothreep">What is Git?</h3>
            <p class="prothreep">Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files.<br/><br/>
            <h3 class="prothreep">This basically means:</h3>
            <p class="prothreep">It's a system that records changes to our files over time.<br/>
                You can recall and go back a specific version of that file at any time.<br/>
                Other developers can collaborate and have a local version of the files in their own computers.</p>
            <h3 class="prothreep">Why use git ?</h3>
            <p class="prothreep">You can store revisions of your project in one directory.<br/>
                Easily go back to your revisions at anytime.<br/>
                Work on new features without messing up with the original codebase.<br/>
                Collaborate with other developers without a geographically constriction.</p> 
            <h3 class="prothreep">What is Github?</h3>
            <p class="prothreep">Github is an online service that you can host your project, share your code and helps other developers to download and work on it. Later they can upload their code edit and merge with main branch/codebase( master branch).</p>
            <h3 class="prothreep"> Git is like your Phone Gallery. While, GitHub is like Google Photos</h3>
            <h3 class="prothreep">What is a Git repository (.git)</h3>
            <p class="prothreep">This is a folder inside your project where git tracks all the changes made in the files and build a history reference over time.<br/> In your project the git repository folder you will see a .git folder.
                Note: The git repository should be at the root of the project folder, for it to track changes to the whole project.</p>
            <h3 class="prothreep">1) git status</h3>
            <p class="prothreep">Running git status will show you which files are currently in the staging area.<br/>
             If the names of the files listed are in red that means they are not in the staging area. But if they are green, they are in the staging and are ready to commit.</p>
            <h3 class="prothreep">2) git add</h3>
            <p class="prothreep">Running git add moves the file/files in the staging area. This helps you to review your changes before you commit.</p>
            <h3 class="prothreep">3) git commit</h3>
            <p class="prothreep">Running this will commit your files in the staging area. You can also add a descriptive message to the commit to help you when reviewing your project folder in the future.</p>
            <h3 class="prothreep">4) Git Pull Request(PR)</h3>
            <p class="prothreep">Generate a request asking your upstream project to pull changes into their tree. The request, printed to the standard output, begins with the branch description, summarizes the changes and indicates from where they can be pulled.</p>
            <h3 class="prothreep">5)Git Push</h3>
            <p class="prothreep">The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo. It's the counterpart to git fetch , but whereas fetching imports commits to local branches, pushing exports commits to remote branches.</p>
            <h3 class="prothreep">6)Git Branch and Merge</h3>
            <p class="prothreep">Say, Person X is working on A huge project with many divisions. Person X will work on the project he is assigned on a new branch 
                Once his work is done, he will merge the work into the Project 
            </p>
            <h3 class="prothreep">Conclusion</h3>
            <p class="prothreep">Git is very useful and important to learn to level up in the tech field. I haven't covered every git or github command but this are the basics that can help you start.</p><br/>
