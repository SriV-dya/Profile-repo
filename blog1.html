            <h1 class="hero-heading">Why Do Most Websites End With <span class="heading-inverted"> .com</span>?</h1>
            <h3>Have you ever wondered why most websites end with a .com? what does it really mean? Did you know website domains ending with a .com cost a lot more than .org or a .in? But why? Interesting isn't it?
                Well, read on.</h3><br/>

            <p>The name com was first heard in the year 1985, its name is derived from the word commercial, indicating its original intended purpose for domains registered by commercial organizations.</p><br/>
            <p>Later on, the domain opened for general purposes.</p><br/>
            <p class="content-padding">Although .com domains were initially intended to designate commercial entities, the domain has had no restrictions for eligible registrants since the mid-1990s. With the commercialization and popularization of the Internet, the domain was opened to the public and quickly became the most common top-level domain for websites, email, and networking. The popularity was mainly driven because the domains using .com flourished in the early 2000s, and the usage of .com more became a norm and a universally accepted extension to a website!</p><br/>
            <p>Now, a lot of Hosting platforms see the demand for a .com to be much higher over its counterparts edu, gov, mil, net, org, and int. and is clearly more expensive because:</p><br/>
            <p>1.Lesser expenditure of funds on PPC advertising. Organic traffic will be greater from a higher ranking premium domain name.</p><br/>
            <p>2.A premium domain name will enhance funding and partnership opportunities with established companies in your industry.</p><br/>
            <p>3.It is also somehow associated with security. A large portion of uninformed audiences thrive on familiarity and feel more secure.</p><br/>
            <p>So, probably with time, as people learned to use websites, they learned it along with the .com and hence could be more instinctive to type a .com against a domain name. And is today seen as a business opportunity!</p>
